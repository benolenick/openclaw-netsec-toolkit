## Executive Summary

{executive_summary}

**Overall Risk Rating:** {overall_risk} ({critical_count} Critical, {high_count} High, {medium_count} Medium, {low_count} Low findings)

---

## Scope & Methodology

- **Scope:** Passive DNS reconnaissance of the listed domains using standard DNS queries (dig, whois, host).
- **Techniques:** Record enumeration (A, AAAA, MX, NS, TXT, SOA, CNAME, CAA, DNSKEY, DS), common subdomain lookup, AXFR zone transfer test, email security checks (SPF/DKIM/DMARC), DNSSEC validation, open resolver detection, WHOIS lookup.
- **Constraints:** No brute-force enumeration. Maximum 3 domains. 0.5s delay between queries. Zone transfers attempted only against authoritative nameservers.
- **Tools:** dig (dnsutils), whois, host.

## Appendix

### Raw Query Data

Full raw output from dig, whois, and host commands is available in `raw-records.txt` in the output directory.

### Methodology Notes

- DKIM checks are limited to common selectors (default, google, selector1, selector2). Custom selectors may exist but are not discoverable via passive DNS queries.
- Zone transfer tests are limited to authoritative nameservers listed in NS records.
- Open resolver checks use a single test query for an unrelated domain; a positive result strongly indicates an open resolver.
- Subdomain checks are limited to a curated list of 17 common names; this is not exhaustive enumeration.
