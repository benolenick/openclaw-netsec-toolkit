## Executive Summary

{executive_summary}

**Overall Risk Rating:** {overall_risk} ({critical_count} Critical, {high_count} High, {medium_count} Medium, {low_count} Low findings)

**Networks Discovered:** {network_count}
**Current Connection:** {current_connection}

---

## Scope & Methodology

- **Scope:** Passive wireless survey of all detectable networks within radio range of the scanning interface.
- **Techniques:** Passive beacon scanning using nmcli (primary) and iwlist (fallback). No packet injection, monitor mode, or active probing.
- **Constraints:** Standard managed-mode scanning only. BSSIDs partially redacted for privacy. No connection attempts to any discovered network.
- **Tools:** nmcli (NetworkManager), iwlist (wireless-tools), iw, iwconfig.

### Signal Strength Reference

| Rating | dBm Range | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Excellent | -30 to -50 | Very strong signal, ideal for high-throughput applications |
| Good | -50 to -60 | Reliable for most applications |
| Fair | -60 to -70 | Adequate for basic browsing, may see occasional drops |
| Weak | -70 to -80 | Unreliable, frequent disconnections likely |
| Very Weak | below -80 | Barely usable, connection may not establish |

### 2.4GHz Channel Overlap Reference

Non-overlapping channels: 1, 6, 11. All other channels overlap with at least one of these and cause co-channel interference.

### Methodology Notes

- Passive scanning detects only networks actively broadcasting beacons at scan time. Networks with very low power or momentarily silent APs may not appear.
- Signal strength is a point-in-time measurement and varies with distance, obstacles, interference, and environmental conditions.
- Hidden SSIDs appear as empty/blank SSID fields. They are trivially discoverable and hiding provides no real security.
- Evil twin detection compares security levels of networks sharing the same SSID. Legitimate multi-AP deployments may have consistent security across all APs.
- BSSIDs are partially redacted (first 8 characters visible) to protect network privacy while allowing cross-reference within the report.
